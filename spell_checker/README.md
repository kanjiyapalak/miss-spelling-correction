Spelling Correction Using Closest Match

Project Description
-> This project implements a simple spelling correction system using Python's difflib library.
-> The program finds the closest correct sentence match for each misspelled sentence in an input file.
-> The corrected output is written to a solution file.

Prerequisites
-> Ensure you have the following installed before running the code:
-> Python 3.x

Installation

-> ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Spelling_Correction_Project.git
cd Spelling_Correction_Project

2. Install dependencies (if any):
-> ```bash
