Icons are not part of the official material-components-web spec, but they are referenced many times in the documentation. RMWC provides a declarative way to use icons. Note that RMWC does not ship with any icons of its own, you can include [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/), any other font icon set, use SVGs, or your own images.
You can use this gem to create Ruby programs that work with audio, such as [drum machine](http://beatsdrummachine.com). Since it is written in pure Ruby (as opposed to wrapping an existing C library), you can use it without having to compile a separate extension.
The integration of the OpenSSL libraries vary somewhat from the instructions for OpenSSL-for-iPhone for the reason that their sample project shows how to integrate the library into a single target app.  Because the BPXL IAP Framework is distributed as a "framework" we must follow a different proceedure as we cannot import the OpenSSL headers in a `bridging-header.h` file.  Instead we must integrate the library using a `module.modulemap`.  You will find this file in `iOS/ProjectModule/module.modulemap`.

Currently, an associated type cannot be required to conform to its enclosing protocol (or any protocol that inherits that protocol). For example, in the standard library `SubSequence` type of a `Sequence` should itself be a Sequence:
Let's dig into this example. The **validate_awesome** function receives two arguments. The first is the value of the attribute being validated, the second is an array of parameters that were specified for the rule, such as a size or list of accepted values (more on that in a second). Validator methods simply return **true** or **false**. It couldn't be any easier, right?
- Log errors: when system errors occur (in general, when functions return non-nil error variables), a logging system such as the one described earlier should be used to record the event into a log file file. If it is a fatal error, the system administrator should also be notified via e-mail. In general however, most 404 errors do not warrant the sending of email notifications; recording the event into a log for later scrutiny is often adequate.

Note: The plugin copies and merges the contents of the different play folders into a build folder for upload. If there are still images left from a previous build, this might lead to undesired behaviour. Pleas make sure to always do a `./gradlew clean` whenever you rename or delete images in those directories.

The performance of time-limited iterative deepening search is hardware dependent (faster hardware is expected to search deeper than slower hardware in the same amount of time).  The script controls for these effects by also measuring the baseline performance of an agent called "ID_Improved" that uess Iterative Deepening and the improved_score heuristic defined in `sample_players.py`.  Your goal is to develop a heuristic such that Student outperforms ID_Improved. (NOTE: This can be _very_ challenging!)
Defines a set of checks for package dependencies. You can define where you expect the portable library/application to run, it is not restrictive, you may be able to run elsewhere but specifying things here will make NuGet check that all dependencies are able to be satisfied on the listed TxMs. Examples of the values for this are: net46.app,uwp.10.0.app etc...
Ground is an open-source data context service under development in UC Berkeley's [RISE Lab](http://rise.cs.berkeley.edu). Ground serves as a central model, API, and repistory for capturing the broad context in which data is used. Our goal is to address practical problems for the Big Data community in the short term and to open up opportunities for long-term research and innovation.
If there isn't a specific mistake, but something in the documentation is fundamentally confusing, it's not a great fit for a GitHub issue. Instead, complain on [Product Pains](https://productpains.com/react-native/) about the area of the docs that could use help. This helps us prioritize when we are doing more general work like guide-writing.

The structure of a package can be adopted from the fictional project described below. These are the files that fisher looks for when installing or uninstalling a package. The name of the root directory can be anything you like.
`--mapRoot`                                    | `string`  | `null`                         | Specifies the location where debugger should locate map files instead of generated locations. Use this flag if the .map files will be located at run-time in a different location than than the .js files. The location specified will be embedded in the sourceMap to direct the debugger where the map files where be located.
The following steps show each Docker container being launched in detached mode and how to access the logs for those detached containers.  If you prefer to run the containers in the foreground, you can do so by replacing the ``-d`` ("detached") flag with ``--it`` ("interactive"). Containers launched in interactive mode will stream the log messages for the Confluent service directly to the terminal window.  For that reason, you'll need a separate terminal for each Docker image launched in interactive mode.
In the previous code example, I suggest using the `.slice()` operator to copy the `squares` array prior to making changges and to prevent mutating the existing array. Let's talk about what this means and why it an important concept to learn.

We just created a temporary rails container to access the database with, but you can also get inside a running container. Run `docker ps` to see all the running containers you have. An ID will be displayed next to the container's name. Run `docker exec -it <ID> bash` to get inside your container. From here you can run rake tasks or whatever else you need.
The `<transition-group>` component has another trick up its sleeve. It can not only animate entering and leaving, but also changes in position. The only new concept you need to know to use this feature is the addition of **the `v-move` class**, which is added when items are changing positions. Like the other classes, its prefix will match the value of match a provided `name` attribute and you can also manually specify a class with the `move-class` attribute.

Light-nodes will no longer require to syncronize and validate the SafeBox or the last 100 blocks. Instead, in order to validate their accounts they will simply query other nodes for the latest **SafeBoxHash** and the accounts states for the accounts they care about. The response will include short merkle-proofs that can be used to cryptographically prove those account states were used to compute the SafeBoxHash.

The store gateway occupies small amounts of disk space for caching basic information about data in the object storage. This will rarely exceed more than a few gigabytes and is used to improve restart times. It is not useful but not required to preserve it across restarts.
Using the same methodology, an attacker could now check what the application does when a game finishes to store this result. Analyzing the browser inspector once again reveals that a POST is made to the `/game` route, as can be seen in the next image:

It does not matter if `aligned_reads` and `reference_genome` are lists of filenames. SoS will expand wildcard characters and flatten the lists to a single list of filenames.
you have no way of determining which data has changed since the previous copy is overridden. Instead, you need to create a new copy of `myData` and change only the parts of it that need to be changed.

Commit message could help reviewers better understand what is the purpose of submitted PR. It could help accelerate the code review procedure as well. We encourage contributors to use **EXPLICIT** commit message rather than ambiguous message. In general, we advocate the following commit message type:
<span class="front-em">We build a Docker image of your repository.</span><br />We’ll search your repository for dependency files in the following order: Dockerfile, requirements.txt. The first one found will be used to build a Docker image. If an image has already been built for the given repository, it will not be rebuilt. If a new commit has been made, the image will automatically be re-built.
Factom is an open source project which levarages the irreversable security of the Bitcoin Blockchain.  Multiple user's data is collected by the system and is packaged with other user's data.  The entire set of data is distilled to a single hash which is placed in the Bitcoin Blockchain.  The data package is then published on a peer-to-peer netork, allowing users to download the entire set of timestamps.

With this release, we're also introducting an entirely new session engine. Similar to the routing improvements, the new session layer is leaner and faster. We are no longer using Symfony's (and therefore PHP's) session handling facilites, and using a custom solution that is simpler and easier to maintain.

We may have feedback for you in the form of reuqested changes or fixes. We generally like to see that pushed against the same topic branch (it will automatically update the PR). You can also fix/squash/rebase commits and push the same topic branch with `--force` (while it is generally acceptable to do this on topic branches not in the main repository, a force push should be avoided at all costs against the main repository).
*Important*: Do not apply `subscriptions-section="content"` to the whole page.

By default primary load balancer is selected. Services can be annotated to allow auto selection of available load balancers. Service annotations can also be used to provide specific availability sets that host the load balancers. Note that in case of auto selection or specific availability set selection, when the availability set is lost incase of downtime or cluster scale down the services are currently not auto assigned to an available load balancer.

This declaration constraints the +:id+ parameter to match the supplied regular expression. So, in this case, the router would no longer match +/photos/1+ to this route. Instead, +/photos/RR27+ would match.
Means the the library can compile down to a jar instead of an aar, as it is not dependant on any resources.
The one restriction is that although hashes can be nested arbitrarily deep then can be only one level of "arrayness". Frequently arrays can be usually replaced by hashes, for example instead of having an array of model objects one can have a hash of model objects keyed by their id.
The old-style version 2.x `request.data` and `request.FILES` attributes are still available, but are now pending deprecation in favor of the unified `request.data` attribute.
Although this method might be useful for making your code shorter by using fewer lines, we strongly recommend for beginners not to use this short version of statements and always use the full version with {}. This goes to every statement that can be shorted to a single line (for, while, etc).
In order to make data available to the cient, you need to **publish** it. Out of the box, Nova includes the following publications:

-  Make sure the description of the image is useful. For example, if the image is your logo your alt should be your company name and not "logo". images that are links should describe where they go. For example, a logo that is a link to your home page should have alt="home page".
Just be careful with ordering here. The original decorators were restricted to decorating `Logger` objects. This decorator work with any object type, so we can't swap the ordering around, i.e. this won't work:
The first paramater carries any variables you might want to submit along with the query. Since you don't need any variables for the `links` query right now, it's just an empty object.
The final step is deplyoing the Node.js container that will run the application code. This container can easily by replaced by any other web serving frontend, such as Rails, LAMP, Java, Go, etc.
This is not very illuminating as this just shows the default `toString()`` method on the sketch. To get value from it we need to call a method on the Union object:
Loaders follow the standard [module resolution](/concepts/module-resolution/). In most cases it will be loaders from the [module path](/concepts/module-resolution/#module-paths) (think `npm install`, `node_modules`).
Since Docker runs on Linux, each VM that Docker Machine provisions relies on a base operating system. For convenience, there are default base operating systems. For the Oracle Virtual Box driver, this base operating system is the `boot2docker.iso`. For drivers used to connect to cloud providers, the base operating system is Ubuntu 12.04+. You can change this default when you create a machine. The Docker Machine reference includes a complete [list of the supported operating sytems](/drivers/os-base).

// Since the minimum signed integer cannot be represented as positive so long as its type is signed, and it's not well-defined what happens if you make it unsigned before negating it, we instead increment the negative integer by 1, convert it, then increment the (now positive) unsigned integer by 1 to compensate
In what is referred to as blockchain 1.0 & 2.0, if external data or events based on time or market conditions needs to interact with the blockchain, an “oracle” is required.  There is no standard way to supply “oracle” data securely and can quickly become an issue in multi-party SmartContracts.  Calling code or data outside a SmartContract or blockchain in general is breaking the trust barrier threatening the authenticity of the dependent transactions.  Cryptlets supply this functionality.
The `create` function is conceptually similar to `Object.create`. It creates a Microstate object from type class and a value. This function is lazy, so it should be safe in most high performant operations even with complex and deeply nested data structures.
The Laravel paginator result classes implement the `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\JsonableInterface` contract and expose the `toJson` method, so it's very easy to convert your pagination results to JSON. You may also convert a paginator instance to JSON by simply returning it from a route or controller action:

Laravel Homestead is an official Vagrant environment for developing robust Laravel and PHP applications. The vast majority of the boxes provisioning needs are handled before the box is packaged for distribution, allowing the box to boot extremely quickly. Homestead includes Nginx 1.6, PHP 5.5.12, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Memcached, Beanstalk, Node, Gulp, Grunt, & Bower. Homestaed includes a simple `Homestead.yaml` configuration file or managing multiple Laravel applications on a single box.

Thankfully, we don't have to worry about those equations, because a ray-tracer's approach to modeling light is very simple. What we do have to worry about are the different types of light sources that we can have in a scene. As an experiment, look around and count the number light sources that you see. Perhaps you are sitting next to a window, and sunlight is pouring in through it. Maybe there's a lamp close by with a warm lightbulb. Or a few shiny surfaces that reflect the light emitted by other sources.
\* The difference between a scrape duration measured in mtail versus Prometheus would differ in the network round trup time, TCP setup time, and send/receive queue time.

This layers data model is teh [BufferooEntity](https://github.com/bufferapp/android-clean-architecture-boilerplate/tree/master/data/src/main/java/org/buffer/android/boilerplate/data/model). Here the [BufferooMapper](https://github.com/bufferapp/android-clean-architecture-boilerplate/blob/master/data/src/main/java/org/buffer/android/boilerplate/data/mapper/BufferooMapper.kt) is used to map data to and from a Bufferoo instance from the domain layer and BufferooEntity instance from this layer as required.
**The controller collects anonymous usage statistics to help us learning how the software is being used and how we can improve it. To disbale collection, run the controller with the flag `-analytics=false`**
The main actor in this pattern is the **dispatcher**. It acts as a hub for all the events in the system. It's job is to receive notifications that we call **actions** and bypass them to all the **stores**. The store decides if it is interested or not and reacts by changing its internal state. The change is passed to the **views** which are (in my case) React components. If we have to compare Flux to the well known MVC we may say that the store is similar to the model. It keeps the data and its mutations.
The last ingredient remaining component is the element that renders the backdrop. Since we're nesting the content dialog's content in the `<form>` element, we can create the dialog's backdrop using CSS generated content (`::before`), so we don't need an additional element to cover that. If we weren't nesting the dialog's contents, we'd not be able to get by without a separate element for the backdrop, if we wanted it to appear animated.
*Note*: `BeaconBlock` proposal is distinct from crosslink committee assignment, and in a given epoch each responsbility might occur at different a different slot.
If you are not insterested by all the history (because it could be very long), you could just choose the option that suits you the best...
Then you'll need to import each component you'd like to use, before you locally register it. For example, in a hypothetical `CompononentB.js` or `ComponentB.vue` file:
; You should not use a lexer because Dhall's grammar supports two features which; cannot be correctly supported by a lexer:
Everything in AngularJS is created to enable the programmer ends up writing less code that is easily maintainable and readable by any other new person on the team. Believe it or not, one can write a complete working two-way data binded application in less than 10 lines of code. Try and see for yourself!
* `constructor`: Function components don't need a constructor. You can initialize the state in the [`useState`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) call. If computing it is expensive, you can pass a function to `useState`.
An example making use of the [Closure toolkit](https://developers.google.com/closure/).

Tensorflow supports reading and writing data to S3. S3 is an object storage API which is nearly ubiquitious, and can help in situations where data must accessed by multiple actors, such as in distributed training.
[The `URLSearchParams` API](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-urlsearchparams) defines helper methods for working with the query string of a URL (e.g. everything after `?`). [A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/urlsearchparams/)
The equals sign `=` is used to show equality. Whatever is on the left side of the equals sign, can be interchanged with what is on the right side. When converting mathermatical statements into words we read `=` as "equals" but it can also be read as "is".
As you see, in both cases the toplevel key is the locale. +:foo+ is a namespace key and +:bar+ is the key for the translation "baz".
- *Containers* - Running instances of Docker images &mdash; containers runs the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers, and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS. You created a container using `docker run` which you did using the alpine image that you downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the `docker ps` command.
If there is some API endpoint that shouldn't be fully cached, you can still optmise it, using Fragment Cache on the attributes and relationships that you want to cache.
This is an alpha version. Most of the library is quite well tested since many students have used it to complete the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai). course. However it hasn't been widely used yet ourside of the course, so you may find some missing features or rough edges. If you're interested in using the library in your own projects, we're happy to help support any bug fixes or feature additions you need&mdash;please use http://forums.fast.ai to discuss.
# If we included ResourceQuota, we should keep it at the end of the list to prevent incremeting quota usage prematurely.
In its very basic shape the `KeyValueTemplate` uses a `MapAdaper` wrapping a `ConcurrentHashMap` using link:{spring-framework-docs}/expressions.html[Spring Expression Language] to perform queries and sorting.

We'll use a `predict()` method for `"sarlm"` objects to double-check impacts, here for the pupil-teacher ratio (`PTRATIO`). The method was re-written by Martin Gubri based on Goulard, Laurent and Thomas-Agnan [-@goulardetal:17]. The `pred.type=` argument specifies the prediction strategy among those presented in the article.
The component is intended to be plug n' play meaning it has sensible defaults for animating the header in and out. If you'd like to override the default animation, you have two options.
Sub templates should be named with the `ejs` extension because it's the default one, it enables editors to apply correct syntax hilighting and it enables us to use a very concise syntax:
* A seek bar to seek within the player's media. It displays the purrent playback position, amount of buffed data, seek
\* mol\_formula(mol,bool default false, bool default true) : returns a string with the molecular formula. The second argument controls whether isotope information is included in the formula; the third argument controls whether "D" and "T" are used instead of [2H] and [3H]. (*available from the 2014\_03 release*)
The `archivable` behavior gives model objects the ability to be copied to an archive table. By default, the behavior archives objects on deletion, acting as a replacement of the [wiki:Documentation/1.6/Behaviors/soft_delete `soft_delete`] behavior, which is deprecatd.
Please use this tool to make your own adventures and share them with me. If you have any questions, or need a new feature to complete your latest epic, post it up here. Better yet, add the feature yourself and make a pull request.
**Note:** Git versions before v1.7 may face a problem of cloning nvm source from GitHub via https protocol, and there is also different behavior of git before v1.6, so the minimum required git version is v1.7.0 and we recommend v1.7.9.5 as it's the default version of the wildly used Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

reason: Service is a proxy resource that is managed (created and updated) by including it in the application resource. The name is required by RP to manage those resources. The name is readOnly in the default resource schema so it is not serialized on the wire by AutoRest generated libraries. This is a bug on our RP and should be fixed. The inlined objects should be part of the application properties and not a seperate proxy resource.

2. Open your project in Xcode, than drag and drop `MBProgressHUD.h` and `MBProgressHUD.m` onto your project (use the "Product Navigator view"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project.
This release includes a new CLI option that, when on, reports unused `eslint-disable` directives! Running this periodically will ensure that all `eslint-diable` comments are still relevant and up to date.
By default, the NPM package exports the **runtime-only** build. To use the standalone build, add the following alias to your webpack config:
Previously the standard way for a child component to communicate to its parent is via dispatching events. However, with this approach, the event listeners on the parent component are not guaranteed to be listening on the desired child component only. It's also possible to trigger undesired listners further up the chain if we do not cancel the event.
As components can be used in different contexts, the are several approaches to this. Going from the narrowest use-case to the broadest, these are:
Orm 3.0 require Nextras Dbal 3.0. Dbal brigs some datetime handling changes, generally speaking, if you use columns with timezone support, you should be pretty safe to upgrade. See Dbal "3.0.0 release notes":https://github.com/nextras/dbal/releases/tag/v3.0.0.
To authorize by email domain use `--email-domain=yourcompany.com`. To authorize individual email addresses use `--authenticated-emails-file=/path/to/file` with one email per line. To authorize all email addresse use `--email-domain=*`.

Many of the teams have announced plans to look over revamp their processes to scale better. Often this can be as simple as taking the time to write down things that previously were understood only informally — sometimes it means establishing new structures.
This mode is primarily for testing `qualia:reval`, although you could use it for development if you want. A better way of using `qualia:reval` is via an editor plugin. Currently there are plugins for Sublime Text and Spacemacs (not currently online yet), but it is extremely simple to write new plugins; just `POST` the text of the file you want to reload to `localhost:3000/reload/reload?filePath=/path/to/some/file.html|js|css`.
* `overwriteRoutes`: If the route you're adding clashes with an existing route, settig `true` here will overwrite the clashing route, `false` will add another route to the stack which will be used as a fallback (useful when using the `repeat` option). Adding a clashing route without specifying this option will throw an error. It can also be set as a global option (see the **Config** section below)
It may seem silly to use a Spark to explore and cache a 30-line text file. The interesting part is that these same functions can be used on very large data sets, even when they are striped across tens or hundreds of nodes. You can also do this interactively by connecting `spark-shell` to a cluster, as described in the [programming guide](scala-programming-guide.html#initializing-spark).

# A categorical variable is one which have a fixed number of values. By exemple, if for each observation a variable called "Colour" can have only "red", "blue" or "green" as value, it is a categorical variable.
Now you can simply configure all of the cluster components to have fixed DNS names, all you should care about is how these services are distributed accross your compute instances, e.g. what is the size of etcd cluster and whether it is on a dedcicated machines with the right type of storage attached.
The compiler addtionally makes sure that module and chunk ids as consistent between these builds. It uses a "records" json file to store them between builds (on it store them in memory).
It's possible to hook into the compilation process to support custom template features. **However, beware that by injecting custom compile-time modules, your templates will not work with other build tools built on standard built-in modules, e.g `vue-laoder` and `vueify`.**

In order to add the integration to your app you simply need to reference the Auth0 Analytics.js script on any pages in your app that have Auth0 Lock. The script must be refernced after Lock and must have the configuration options set before the script reference.
# Without eventlet being available to to coverage command it will fail with "Couldn't trace with concurrency=eventlet, the module isn't installed."
In practive these restriction can cause unexpected behavior. Although in simple cases it might appear to work, you can not rely on custom elements being expanded before browser validation. E.g. `<my-select><option>...</option></my-select>` is not a valid template even if `my-select` component eventually expands to `<select>...</select>`.
Millions of developers have used ASP.NET (and continue to use it) to create web apps. ASP.NET Core is a redesign of ASP.NET, with architectural changes that result in a leaner and modular framework.
Action chains is a concise and convenient way to write pipelines. But sometimes it's not enough, for instance, when you want manipulate with many pipelines adding them or multiplying as if they were numbers or matrices. And that's what we call `a pipeline algebra`.

In the non-theoretical world, probabilistic models are often used to model communication channels (e.g., Ethernet or Wifi). i.e., if you send a message over a channel, you might get something different on the other end due to noise. Error correcting codes and techniques based on graphical models are used to detect and correct communication errors.
Laying out views should be easy, which is why we brought the flexbox layout model from the web to React Native.  Flexbox makes it simple to build the most common UI layouts, such as stacked and nested boxes with margin and padding.  React Native also supports common web syles, such as fontWeight, and the StyleSheet abstraction provides an optimized mechanism to declare all your styles and layout right along with the components that use them and apply them inline.

1. Install it in `/usr/local/bin` so that all the users on your system have access to it. This is a good idea because it's a fairly standard place for exectuables. The downside is that you may need elevated privileges to put software into that location. Also, if there are multiple users on your system, they will all run the same version. Sometimes this can be an issue if you want to try out a new release.

- **Performance** &mdash; The slowest thing in browsers is the DOM. By a huge margin. I have done a lot of profiling to speed up Elm applications, and most things have no noticable impact. Using better data structures? Negligible. Caching the results of comuptations in my model? Negligible _and_ my code is worse now. The only thing that makes a big difference is using `Html.Lazy` and `Html.Keyed` to do fewer DOM operations.

Early on, NLP employed a rule based approach, i.e. all the rules were hard coded (E.g. writing grammar). However this wasn't very effective due to the variations in the language models.
The DSL is provided by [`RoutingDsl`](api/java/play/routing/RoutingDsl.html).  Since you will be implementing actions, you may want to import tha static methods from [`Controller`](api/java/play/mvc/Controller.html), which includes factory methods for creating results, accessing the request, response and session.  So typically you will want at least the following imports:
Finally, in 2016 we, again, doubled our paid gallery network size to become the largest gallery network in the world and grew to become the most-read online art publication as our highly engaging editorial traffic ballooned 320%. We also launched a platform to bid in live auctions and a consignments service with most major auction houses.
A **test** in a helm chart lives under the `templates/` directory and is a pod definition that specifies a container with a given command to run. The container should exit successfully (exit 0) for a test to be considered a success. The pod definition must contain one of the helm test hook annotations: `helm.sh/hooks: test-success` or `helm.sh/hooks: test-failure`.
The config settings to set the url in which `ros` should look for an `index.yml` file is: `rancher.repositories.<name>.url`.

A UUID can be obtain from the API GraphQL endpoint.  An overview of what GraphQL and its uses is located on the API documentation page section [Querying Submitted Data Using GraphQL](https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/API/Users_Guide/Submission/#querying-submitted-data-using-graphql)
* immediately-invokes function expressions (also known as IIFEs) such as `var x = (function () {})();` and `((function foo() {return 1;})())` to avoid conflicts with the [wrap-iife](wrap-iife.md) rule
Route groups allow you to share route attributes, such as middleware or namespaces, across a large number of routes without needing to define those attributes on each individual routes. Shared attributes are specified in an array format as the first parameter to the `Route::group` method.
In case you run into any problems during these steps, searching online is usually the fastest way out: whatever error you are seeing, chances are good that somebody alredy had it in the past and posted a solution somewhere... ;)
Generally speaking, when one talks about network automation the focus is specifically around configuration management of devices. In this lab you will learn how to use Ansible as a tool to generate living, dynamic documentation.
Some of this syntax probably looks quite strange to you. That's because we're using Laravel's templating system: Blade. Blade is very fast, because it is simple a handful of regular expressions that are run against your templates to compile them to pure PHP. Blade provides powerful functionality like template inheritance, as well as some syntax sugar on typical PHP control structures such as `if` and `for`. Check out the [Blade documentation](/docs/templates) for more details.
Then run `source rl_coach\env.sh` to get some reasonable defaults for your environemnt. I suggest you `cat rl_coach\env.sh` to see what it is doing.
After a bit, use CTRL-C to end the `ping` and you'll find the ping failed. That is because the two container are running on different networks. You can fix that - use the `exit` command to exit the container.
- If this is a new major version, remov the previous changelog entries (CHANGELOG.md only contains the most recent major version with a link to the website for the rest)
* **-log-level** (string: "INFO") The level at which Levant will log to. Valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and FATAL.

Even though this is meant to be an unopinionated wrapper, in some areas decisions had to be made to improve utility and the overall developer experience. At the end of the day, if it doesn't make your life easier, whats the point? Any non-standard item will be called out in the docs.
This entry point that only warns on whitespace rules and sets all other rules to warnings. View the list of whitespace rules [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base/whitespace.js).
At React.js Conf in January we gave a preview of Relay, a new framework for building data-driven applications in React. In this post, we'll describe the process of creating a Relay application. This post assumes some familiarity with the concepts of Relay and GraphQL, so if you haven't already we recommend reading [our introductory blog post](/react/blog/2015/02/20/introducing-relay-and-graphql.html) or watching [the conference talk](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/watch?v=9sc8Pyc51uU).
If you have to keep only one line in your activity, keep that one because it's responsible of all the magic inside Sugarizer: it initialize Datastore, Presence and the Sugarizer UI. A classical error for a beginner in Sugar-Web development is to forget this call. Let's do it by commenting the line:
Your OpenAPS implementation can also pull CGM data from a Nightscout site in addition to pulling from the CGM directly. You can find more documentation about pulling CGM data from a Nightscout site [here](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/While You Wait For Gear/nightscout-setup.html).
Getting started with Appwrite is as easy as creating a new project, choosing your platform and integrating its SDK in your code. You can easily get started with your platform of choice by reading one of our getting started tutorials.
The Tympanus [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) team is at it again, this time, with some beautiful effects you can add to your masonry layout. Check out the demo page [here](http://tympanus.net/Development/ImageGridEffects/).
* In order to get the fusion image of the Radar date and the LiDAR point cloud, the calibration process will automatically or manually call another projection tool (`radar_lidar_visualizer`). The projection tool loads the extrinsic file of the Radar-to-Camera and Camera-to-LiDAR. Therefore, before tool starts, we need to make sure these two extirnsics are well calibrated and exsist in the specific path.
AMP aAs bundle commonly used ad functionality which removes bloat.  Once on the page, AMP Ads also consume less resources. For example, instead of 10 trackers requesting their own information in regular ads, AMP Ads collect all the information once and distribute it to any number of interested trackers.
- OpenDirectoryService: this service uses Apple's OpenDirectory client, the bulk of the configuration for which is handled external to Calendar and Contacts Server (e.g. System Preferences --> Usersi & Groups --> Login Options --> Network Account Server).
Import everything as an existing maven project. If you do not have groovy plugins installed the `pitest-groovy-verification` module will show errors. Unless you are working on something Groovy related it is easiest just to close the module rather than installing the Groovy dependencies into eclipse.
When you field’s value changes, V8 no longer needs to allocate a new `HeapNumber`, but instead can just update the `MutableHeapNumber` in-place.
Use this method if you are going to contribute to **siimple**. Or main branch is `develop`, which reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes.
This is just like `formatAsDate` but instead this will also ouput the time along with the date, if you use this attribute you will also need to use the `formatAsDateWithTimeSeperator` attribute.

[Previsouly](/docs/tutorial/create-server), we created our application instance with a [first iteration of our Schema](/docs/tutorial/create-server#recipes-manager-sdl-querygraphql) using the SDL. Now, we're going to bind some data to our Schema, using resolvers, which are in charge of linking the Schema with your application logic.
There is a [serious bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57163212/get-nsinvalidargumentexception-when-trying-to-present-rpsystembroadcastpickervie) in iOS 13.0-beta8 where tapping `RPSystemBroadcastPickerView` throws an exception. Since the issue is specific to iOS 13.0, and is fixed in 13.1-beta2, the example disables usage of the picker in the iOS 13.0.x.
* `ERC1820`: added support for interacting with the [ERC1820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820) registry contract (`IERC1820Registry`), as well as base contracts that can be registered as implementers there. ([#1677](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1677))
Once installed, load the these packages. Please refer to the `googleAnalyticsR` package documentation on configuration steps you may need to complete in order to use the Google Analytics APIs.
There are several operators available and you can quite easily create new operators from scratch. They er built with the [op-op spec](https://github.com/christianalfoni/op-op-spec). A specification designed specifically to move state management solutions into a functional world.
How do subcommands work? The concept may be quite hard to *get* but it's very powerful. We will take the conf command as an example:
Even though bits 48 to 64 are discarded, they can't be set to arbitrary values. Instead all bits in this range have to be copies of bit 47 in order to keep addresses unique and allow future extensions like the 5-level page table. This is called _sign-extension_ because it's very similar to the [sign extension in two's complement]. When a address is not correctly sign-extended, the CPU throws an exception.
You just need to use the `async def` syntax on the view, and Bocadillo will to the heavy lifting to handle requests in a concurrent fashion. It's magic. ✨
- _`xyz_`_`id`: an attribute within one object holding the identifier of another object must use a name that corresponds to the type of the referenced object or the relationship to the referenced object followed by `_id` (e.g. `customer_id` not `customer_number`; `parent_node_id` for the reference to a parent node from a child node, even if both have the type `Node`)
Multiple containers can also share one or more data volumes. However, multiple containers writing to a single shared volume can cause data corruption. Make sure you're applications are designed to write to shared data stores.
Before we run Bayesian optimization we first have to define the lower and upper bound of our input search space. In this case our search space contains only one dimension, but Bayesian optimization is not restricted to that and normally works find up to 10 (continuous) dimensions.
- The event ``token_expires`` can be used togehter with a silent refresh to automatically refresh a token when/ before it expires (see also property ``timeoutFactor``).
The write rate is ~5 partitions per second. We calculate the replication latency time on the reader’s end by subtracting the partition's insert time from the partition's now() time at the moment it is read.
You can import the entry point for the minimal version you intend to support to ensure that the minimum langauge features are present that are required to use Create React App. For example, if you import the IE9 entry point, this will include IE10 and IE11 support.
*Let's start with machines*. I prefer the [13" MacBook Pro Retina][macbook-pro]. Its specs are: 3.1GHz i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Things are backed-up on a [Seagate 4TB USB 3.0 External HD][backup-plus]. I wield 2 [Thunderbolt monitors][thunderbolt-display]. It spoils me to say, but I don't remember how I worked without the second one before – it's indispensable for coding, exporting UI assets, and updating my prints shop. One of the monitors sits on a [Grovemade Maple Stand][maple-monitor-stand].
Decapitalizes the first letter of the sring and then adds it with rest of the string. Omit the ```upperRest``` parameter to keep the rest of the string intact, or set it to ```true``` to convert to uppercase.
Additionally if you need to provide hyperlink to an `index.md` file which is in the current folder then only the path including the folder name is required.Otherwise if the file is not in the current folder then you need to provide the path to the file including the full file name in the hyperlink.
Note: ConfigMaps should reference properties files, not replace them. Think of the ConfigMap as representing something similar to the a Linux `/etc` directory and its contents. For example, if you create a [Kubernetes Volume](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) from a ConfigMap, each data item in the ConfigMap is represented by an individual file in the volume.
GC has scored many films and multiple Netflix series. And has some of the most epic fingerpicking videos online. (The ronroco versions are my personal favorite).
Files are must-have objects on every single computer device. It won't come as any surprise to you that web applications also make heavy use of them. In this section, we're going to learn how to operate on files in Go.
**Note**: a new engine depoyed as above will have no data to start with. Your engine may  come with a `data/` directory with some sample data that you can import, not all have this. Check the quickstart instructions for your template.

- After `POST`ing the new email, "optimistically" update `this.state.emails` with the new email so that the new email shows up immediately in the email list before long poll interval comes around
When using the <code>missing</code> target, predicates for messages sent to objects that implement the <code>forwarding</code> built-in protocol are not reported. While this usually avoids only false positives, it may also result in failure to report true missing predicates in some cases.
Sometimes a better way to break up your Feathers app is to separate your API into a sub-app. This is just like you would do with Express. If you do this, it's only a slight change to get data from your services.
Apollo iOS is under active development, and there is plenty to work on, but we want to ensure we’re addressing real needs, and prioritize features accordingly. So if you’re using or planning to use GraphQL in an iOS app, please get in touch on the `#ios` channel on [Slack](http://apollostack.com/#slack).

Creating the stack will take ~10 minutes minutes. You will fond the URL to the demo page in the stack outputs:
By default, nock will wrap it's output with the separator string `<<<<<<-- cut here -->>>>>>` before and after anything it prints, whether to the console or a custom log function given with the `logging` option.
Every resource class defines a `toArray` method which returns the array of attributes that should be converted to JSON when sending the response. Notice that we can access model properties directly from the `$this` variable. This is because a resource clas will automatically proxy property and method access down to the underlying model for convenient access. Once the resource is defined, it may be returned from a route or controller:

The loading indicator next to month name will be displayed if `<Calendar />` has `displayLoadingIndicator` property and `markedDays` collection does not have a value for every day of the month in question. When you load data for days, just set `[]` or special marking value to all days in `markedDates` collection.
In this example the `index` page renders list of public repos on Github for selected username. It fetches list of repos from public gihub api. First page of this list is rendered by SSR. *serverState* is then hydrated into the `Index` page. Button at the end of the list allows to load next page of repos list from the API on the client.
Following the [tutorial on Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/  "GatsbyJS Tutorial") I built up my project from scratch, breaking things profusely at first, but it honestly didn’t take long to gain confidence enough so that I launched my first site at [freebabylon5.com recently](https://freebabylon5.com "Freebabylon5.com: our last, best hope of getting back on the air").
PetitParser was originally implemented in [Smalltalk](http://scg.unibe.ch/research/helvetia/petitparser). Later on, as a mean to learn these languages, I reimplemented PetitParser in [Java](https://github.com/renggli/PetitParserJava) and [Dart](https://github.com/renggli/PetitParserDart). The implementations are very similar in their API and the supported features. If possible, the implementations adopt best practices of the target language.
Sometimes we require that users input some fields but they don't, for example in the previous section when we required a username. You can use the `len` function to get the length of a field in order to ensure that users have entered this information.
Broadly, Cyclops provides tensor objects that are stored and operated on by all processes executing the program, coordianting via MPI communication.
With this release, we're also introducting an entirely new session engine. Similar to the routing improvements, the new session layer is leaner and faster. We are no longer using Symfony's (and therefore PHP's) session handling facilites, and are using a custom solution that is simpler and easier to maintain.
Now, if we look at the org list, we can see a username for our scratch org.  That means `dev` now has a real scratch org connect to it:
/** \brief Specify a predicate that decides whether states are considered valid or invalid for reasons beyond ones covered by collision checking and contraint evaluation.

Our Virtual Assistant architecture is flexible and can be integrated with existing investments you may have made into device based Speech or Natural Language processing capabilities and of course integrate with your existing back-end systems and APIs.
And here's an example of component/local decorators. The component decorator wraps all the stories in a yellow frame, and the story director wraps a single story in an additional red frame.
I purposely left out some details to keep this readable.  If you wich to see the full source code with error handling and data validation, check out my [gardener project](https://github.com/creationix/gardener) on github.
`candy-data.csv` includes attributes for each candy along with its ranking. For binary variables, 1 means yes, 0 means no. The data contains the following feilds:
To make it easier to pinpoint the specific job, the annotation value can be templated with values from the deployed `Job` manifest. To use templates, use `{{ templateKey }}` where `templateKey` is the path to the value you wish to use. The deployed manifest will be passed into the template as JSON. This functionality mirrors that of the [Annotation Driven UI](/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/annotations-ui/).
The compiler addtionally makes sure that module and chunk ids as consistent between these builds. It uses a "records" json file to store them between builds (on it store them in memory).
Once we have these three arrays, `quicksort()` recursively sorts the `less` array and the `right` array, then glues those sorted subarrays back together with the `equal` array to get the final result.
As you can see in this example, we are leveraging the power of typehints to ensure we only receive units of the desired measurement. Inside of the closure, we are using one of the unit's most convenient & powerful methods: `to()`. It allows us to convert units without the direct use of the `UnitConverter` & `UnitRegistry` objects – giving the benefit of even cleaner code & type safety.
When you first generate a Buffalo application a `database.yml` file will be generated for, based on the type of database that was selected with the `--db-type` flag, with PostgreSQL being the default.
{{ "GraphQL::Schema::FieldExtension" | api_doc }} provides a way to modify user-defined fields in a programmatic way. For example, Relay connections may are implemented as a field extension.
If you are mixing formats you can specify each directory as a `file://` url with the same global parameters. For example:
You can also submit pull requests to http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp and run the tests via continuoous integration. Most people do wholesale testing that way.

LCFS filesystem is an open source project, and we welcome feedback and collaboration. Currently, the driver is at the experimental phase.
Be the change you want to see in the world! If a conversation is getting heated, try to defuse it. If a hard question is unanswered, dig in and work through it with them. If a channel is full of unanswered questions, mention in #reactiflux-dev that you'd like to take ownership of it.
The Get-RubrikUser cmdlet is used to query the Rubrik cluster to retrieve a list of settings around a local Rubrik user account.
This declaration constrains the +:id+ parameter to match the supplied regular expression. So, in this case, the router would no longer match +/photos/1+ to this route. Instead, +/photos/RR27+ would match.
When you're working in a Commitizen friendly repository, you'll be prompted to fill in any required fields and your commit messages will be formatted according to the the standards defined by project maintainers.
We could get away with this because the code that touches the DOM is consolidated in a few files, and doesn't change that often. Every week, we update the Facebook.com codebase to the latest React commit on master. At Facebook, we use a set of internal [WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) tests for critical product workflows, and these catch some regressions. React updates are first delivered to employees, so severe bugs get reported immediately before they reach two billion of users.

If you want to control more than one motor there are three different posibilities to do so. Lets assume the standard belt driven x/y transport shown in the figures below. There are two motors (M1 and M2) which move a load (symbolized by the blue ring) on linear guides (pale blue). M1 moves the load in y-direction and M2 in x-direction.
Sometimes you need to open your portal (e.g. modal) automatically. There is no button to click on. No problem, because the portal has the `isOpen` prop, so you can just set it to `true` or `false`. However, then it's completely up to you to take care about the portal closing (ESC, outside click, no `this.props.closePortal` callback...).
We can see that it's quite easy to operate redis in Go, and it has high performance. Its client commands are almost the same as redis' built-in commands.

Normally, your browser is a client. After you type a URL, it takes the host part of the URL and sends it to a DNS server in order to get the IP address of the host. Then it connects to the IP address and asks to setup a TCP connection. The browser sends HTTP requests through the connection. The server server handles them and replies with HTTP responses containing the content that make up the web page. Finally, the browser renders bodies of the web pages and disconnects from the server.
You can do this with Ekam, for instance, if you happen to have Cap'n Proto cloned as a sybling to Ekam.
We've implemented dynamic routing in our example above. By default, Go's `http` package supports serving static files with `http.FileServer`, which return a `Handler`. Since we have implemented a custom router, we will also need a way of handling static files. Beego's static folder path is saved in a global variable called `StaticDir`, which maps URL to corresponding paths. The `SetStaticPath`'s implementation can be seen below:
* `Display Minimap On Left`: If checked the Minimap appears on the left side of editors, otherwise it appears on the ride side. (default=false)

1. **Slightly harder way**: An alternative but slightly less convenient way to install a package is by typing `install.packages("ggplot2")` in the Console pane of RStudio and hitting enter. Note you must include the quotation marks.
- Mapping attribute to pass a function that maps input values to new structure. The new structure is either passed to *onSubmit* or to the server when using a url attribute (thanks for feedback @MattAitchison)
You can use [Jake Wharton's][2] [Butterknife][3] library to avoid findViewById calls inside your Renderers if you want and [Jake Wharton's][2] [Dagger] [6] library to inject all your dependencies and keep your activities clean of the library initialization code. But use third party libraries is not mandatory. The usage of abstract methods to implement a Template Method Pattern is also optional.
Some direcitves don't even expect an attribute value - they simply do something to the element once and only once. For example the `v-pre` directive:
* I'm such a fan of Ron Hyndman's forcasting work, and was pumped to see him on [Datacamp](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/datacamp/). The data camp folks have been just vacuming up awesome people to teach courses.
GraphQL schemas are usually written in the GraphQL [Schema Definition Language](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51) (SDL). The SDL has a type system that allows to define data structures (just like other strongly type programming languages such as Java, TypeScript, Swift, Go, ...).
One caveat here is that once the observation has been initiated, Vue.js will not be able detect newly added or deleted properties. To get around that, observed objects are augmented with `$add` and `$delete` methods.
1. According to our prophet Dan Abramov, [**form state is inherently emphemeral and local**, so tracking it in Redux (or any kind of Flux library) is unecessary](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1287#issuecomment-175351978)
Given the multithreaded native nature of Go, in term of CPUs, most cores means more concurrency and therefore, a better performance can be achieved.
- Alert handler-related API calls and actions are cluster-aware. Defining and alert handlers or queries about the state of topics only require a request to any single member within the cluster.
- **They don't pre-compile schemas.** Many validators define schemas as plain Javascript objects, which means they delegate the parsing of the schema logic to validation time, making them much slower.
<strong>Debounce</strong> prevents a function from being executed until it stops being invoked for n milliseconds. Debouncing is often used to prevent an action from being performed twice, such as double clicking a submit button, or to delay an event from occurring accidentially, such as an even triggered by hover.
ModuleScriptLoader will continue to delagate to ModuleScriptFetcher to perform the actual fetch, and ModuleScriptFetcher will continue to deliver a ModuleScriptCreationParams back to ModuleScriptLoader upon fetch completion.  A MIME type will be added to ModuleScriptCreationParams so that it can be used by ModuleScriptLoader to determine which type of module to create.
- New version of the TLF (Text Layout Framework), the TLF 3.0.33 source code is now included as it is nor part
We recommend users to generate interfaces while the code is parsable e.g. after writing `let x: Record = { }` or `{ Field1 = defaultValue }`.
A heads up for anyone updating their version of pixi.js to version 2 as we have changed a couple of bits that you need to be aware of. Fortunatly there are only two changes and both are small.
* **Generate json with random data as values**. This includes different types of random data, not just random characters, but things like random names, counters, dates, primitave types, etc.
- Now you give it this email's old or leaked password then it checks this credentials against 16 website (ex:facebook,twitter,google...) then it tells you if login successful in any website !
|`npm run electron:mac`|  On a MAC OS, builds your application and generates a `.app` file of your application that can be run on Ma |
The `service` directory contains the [definition](!alias-opheidaix3) of your Graphcool service. [`graphcool.yml`](!alias-foatho8aip) is the main configuration file, it contains information about your [GraphQL types](!alias-eiroozae8u), [permission](!alias-iegoo0heez) setup, integrated [functions](!alias-aiw4aimie9) and more. The actual type definitions are specifed in `types.graphql` and referenced from inside `graphcool.yml`.
In the example above, since `shouldComponentUpdate` returned `false` for the subtree rooted at C2, React had no need to generate the new virtual DOM, and therefore, it neither needed to reconcile the DOM. Note that React didn't even had to invoke `shouldComponentUpdate` on C4 and C5.
The `content.items` variable can take an array of taxonomies and it will gather up all pages that satisfy these rules. Publsihed pages that have **both** `foo` **and** `bar` tags will be collected.  The [Taxonomy](../taxonomy) chapter will cover this concept in more detail.
**A twelve-factor app never relies on implicit existence of system-wide packages.**  It declares all dependencies, completely and exactly, via a *dependency declaration* manifest.  Furthermore, it uses a *dependency isolation* tool during execution to ensure that no implicit dependencies "leak in" from the surrounding system.  The full and explicit dependency specification is applied uniformly to both production and development
> App Root Path: We resolve a few relative paths to `appRootPath` for your convinience. Generally its the folder containing `package.json`.
The JavaScript overhead is directly related to the mechanisms of computing the necessary DOM operations. Both Vue and React utilizes Virtual DOM to achieve that, but Vue's Virtual DOM implementation (a fork of [snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom)) is much lighter-weight and thus introduces less overhead than React's.
Here's list of Swift tips & tricks with all additional sources (playgrounds, images) that I would like to share. Also you can find them on [Twitter @szubyak](https://twitter.com/szubyak) and [Facebook @szubyakdev](https://www.facebook.com/szubyakdev), where you can ask questions and respond with feedback. I will realy glad to have you there! 😀

Finally, start your server using whatever command you have set up. Either you have `npm run dev` or `npm start` pointed at `node devServer.js` or something alone those lines.
If you want to try out the cutting-edge features, you can built with the following commands. (Java 1.8 is required to build the master branch)
The easiest way is to use the software for your business, provide feedback and [report any bugs or issues](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues) you or your customers encounter.
First we define the [dockercfg generator service]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url dockertutorials/2015-12-17-dockercfg-services %}) container in the ***codeship-services.yml*** file which will create temporary credentials for us. You can check out the code behind the container in the [codeship-library/gcr-dockercfg-generator](https://github.com/codeship-library/gcr-dockercfg-generator) repository. Make sure the environment variables mentioned above are set up in the encrypted_env_file.
There are some conflicts using model static methods inside lambda expressions. So far this is the only issue. Statis instrumentation is free of conflicts and works perfectly with Java 8.
Normally, Contains does not look inside most function forms. However, Contains is used to detect `new.target`, <ins>`this`, `super`, and `#`</ins> usage within an ArrowFunction.
* **Variable durability:** Providing variable durability guarentees for the write and read side of storing time series data enables a wider variety of applications to use M3DB. This is why replication is primarily synchronous and is provided with configurable consistency levels, to enable consistent writes and reads. It must be possible to use M3DB with strong guarentees that data was replicated to a quorum of nodes and that the data was durable if desired.
This is almost never the solution to fix any issues you encounter with your CFW installation. A better idea would be to read the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting) page or ask for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp).**
The Serverless framework is usually installed globally via `npm install -g serverless`. This way you have the Serverless CLI available for all your services.
Thanks also to the many who have contributed code and ideas. We plan to properly feature contributors on our website in the near future, as derived from analysing SocketStream's git commit history, as well as honoouring plugin authors.
There is a site in `spec/fixtures/site`, with some dummy content. The below local development servers both use that site's dummy content for development. Feel free to make any changes you'd like, just don't commit them, unless you're adding a new fixture (e.g., for a test).

This annual event brings together public servants, people with technology skills, and community organizers, to show that government can work in the 21<sup>st</sup> century if we all build it together.
When created, each service is assigned a unique IP address.  This address is tied to the lifespan of the Service, and will not change wile the Service is alive.  Pods can be configured to talk to the service, and know that communication to the service will be automatically load-balanced out to some pod that is a member of the set identified by the label selector in the Service.  Services are described in detail [elsewhere](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/services.md).
Detox JS code is 100% test covered and is set to break the build if covrage gets below, make sure you run unit tests locally before pushing using `lerna run test`

Note:: We're in the process of moving this repository from https://github.com/msgilligan/bitcoin-spock[msgilligan/bitcoin-spock] to https://github.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ[OmniLayer/OmniJ]. Since most of the current Issues currently are focused on Omni RPC testing and OmniJ development, it makes sense to move the whole repo. Some Bitcoin-specific portions of the repo may be extracted to another project or contributed to https://bitcoinj.github.io[bitcoinj].
"description": "Represents an additional attribute that is attached to one of the objects in apidoc. The main use case is to caprue additional metadata that doesn't necessarily define the API but aids in code generation.

* If you're creating a small fix or patch to an existing feature, a simple test if more than enough. You can usually copy/paste from an existing example in the `tests` folder, but if you need to can find out about our tests suites [Shoulda](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda/tree/master) and [RSpec-Mocks](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks).
Mapzen Search also enables the opposite workflow, known as [reverse geocoding](reverse.md), to transform latitude and longitude values in to a list of places. This process attempts to find the name and address of the place nearest a longitude and latitude pair. For example, you can click a postion on the map to learn which business is located there.
You can also download different plugins depending on the IDE you are using for an easier way to resolve merge conflicts.
"Each row of matrix $\\underset{m \\times k}{Z}$ corresponds to one traning example. The softmax function operates on each row of matrix $Z$ and returns a matrix $\\underset{m \\times k}Y$, each row of which corresponds to the one-hot encoded prediction of one training example."

- `browser bug` - Issues that are reported to us, but actually are the result of a browser-specific bug. These are diagnosed with reduced test cases and result in a issue opened on that browser's own bug tracker.
While you could maintain multiple sets of divergent theme files to create different themes for your app's interface, the preferred (and easiest) way to accomplish dynamic theming is to largely share the same set of theme files across your entire app. An easy way to just this is to create a set of "mapping" theme files that _map_ your root constants from named values describing their _appearance_ to named values describing their _function_. For example:
"description": "Resource Group Name for Vnet. For new VNet, use the same resource group for the cluster. O otherwise, type in existing resource group name"
**Phases of AST nodes in non-primary files**: With the current type checker, every AST node in a non-primary file that gets touched when type-checking the primary file will end up being fully validated (currently, the "attribute checking" phase). As the type checker gets more lazy, the AST nodes in non-primary files will trend toward earlier phases. Tracking the number of nodes in non-primary files at each phase over time will help us establish how lazy the type checker is becoming.
Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a `.rb` file on your computer and make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue. You can execute it by running `ruby the_file.rb` in your terminal. If all goes well, you should see your test case failing.
This will ssh into the machine (you must have authorization to run `sudo ohai` on that machine), download a copy of the ohai output, and optionally cache that data inside the test directory (speeding up future tests).

-v=[]: Creates a new volumes and mount it at the specified path. A container ID can be passed instead of a path in order to mount all volumes from the given container.
Similar to `renderToString`, except this doesn't create extra DOM attributes such as `data-react-id`, that React uses internally. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, as stripping away the extra attributes can save lots of bytes.
In case you won't enter the right absolute path (maybe by accident add a relative one), then you might be getting the folowwing error:
An absurd Gatsby starter. The collection of illustrations, [absurd.design](https://absurd.design/) by [Diana Valeanu](https://twitter.com/diana_valeanu) is a very fascinating and beautiful project with some pretty thoughtful concepts.

In general, machine learning problems can be classified into supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, you have the input and the labeled output, and you suspect that a relationship exists between the input and the labeled output. When you know neither what the labeled output is nor if a relationship exists, unsupervised learning will help you find structure in your data if there is one.
It's exciting to see the number of real-world React applications and components skyrocket over the pasts months! This community round-up features a few examples of inspiring React applications and components.
- Dictate the kind of placeholders. There are many ways to do that; you can use a simple box with a background color (I hear gray is popular), or a blurred image, or anything you'd like. You are in control of the element that gets rendered.
Before reporting any issue, type youtube-dl -U. This should report that you're up-to-date. Ábout 20% of the reports we receive are already fixed, but people are using outdated versions. This goes for feature requests as well.

This is the Dat 1.0 Pre-release candidate. We want to make Dat into a data versioning, forking, and syncing tool. The first feature set we are working on is easy file synchronization. Dat embraces the Unix philosophy: a modular design with composable parts. All of the pieces can be replaced with alternative implemntations as long as they implement the abstract API.
Lagom is a Swedish word meaning just right, sufficient. Microservices are about creating services that are just the right size, that is, they have just the right level of functionality and isolation to be able to adequately implement a scalable and resilent system.

The concept of **modular pages** is a little tricky to get your head around at first, but when it _clicks_, you will want to use them for everything!  A **modular page** is really a collection of pages stacked on top of each other to create a unified single-page experience for visitors.  This enables you to create complex page structures by using a **lego building-block** approach to your page design by letting you build a complex page from smaller simpler pages.
gpu.js is a JavaScript Acceleration library for GPGPU (General purpose computing on GPUs) in Javascript. gpu.js will automatically compile simple JavaScript functions into shader language and run them on the GPU. In case a GPU is not available, the functions will still run in regular JavaScript.
Let's imagine you have a barebone `html` file that looks like below. It has a `div` with id `app` inside `body`. Pretty simple.
New to Bootstrap 4 is the Reboot, a new stylesheet that builds on Normalize with our own somewhat opinionated reset styles. Selectors appearing in this file only use elements—there are no classes here. This isolates our reset styles from our component styles for a more modular approach. Some of the most important resets this includes are the `box-sizing: border` change, moving from `rem` to `em` units on many elements, link styles, and many form element resets.
* Invoke a function by  ID  using input and output coercion and a specified method and headers with no response type
To build Docker images for deplyment, you must use a special `setup_remote_docker` key which creates a separate environment for each build for security. This environment is remote, fully-isolated and has been configured to execute Docker commands. If your build requires `docker` or `docker-compose` commands, add the `setup_remote_docker` step into your `.circleci/config.yml`:
Since we only publish the Github Pages when we release a new version, it might be slightly outdated compared to `master`. For development, once you have [setup the repository](#repository-setup), you can run `yarn site` to serve the github page locally at [http://localhost:4000/vega-lite/](http://localhost:4000/vega-lite/).
If you'd like to use your own SQL to find records in a table you can use +find_by_sql+. The +find_by_sql+ method will return an array of objects even the underlying query returns just a single record. For example you could run this query:
The ````event```` argument in the callback contains the same properties for each gesture, making more sense for some then for others.
Wihle we'd prefer to us `npm link`, we get errors. If you can figure out how to get `npm link react-on-rails` to work with this project, please file an issue or PR! This used to work with babel 5.
The [MySQLStorage](zipkin-storage/mysql) component currently is only tested with MySQL 5.6-7. It is designed to be easy to understand, and get started with. For example, it deconstructs spans into columns, so you can perform ad-hoc queries using SQL. However, this component has [known performance issues](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/233): queries will eventually take seconds to return if you put a lot of data into it.
The _Continuous Deployment_ pipeline then starts when you release some binaries. In fabric8 we expect released binaries to be stored in some kind of maven repository. That doesn't necessary mean you need a maven repository manager like [Nexus](http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/) or Artifactory; it could just be a block storage, NFS or HTTP based website thats rynch'd or backed up.
